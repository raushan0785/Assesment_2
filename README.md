# ðŸ“Š Marketing Mix Modeling with Mediation Analysis

This project implements a **Marketing Mix Model (MMM)** using mediation analysis to explore how Google Ads spend acts as a mediator between social media channels and revenue.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### âœ… Prerequisites

Make sure Python 3.8+ is installed along with these libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn joblib jupyter
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>

# Navigate to the project folder
cd <project-folder>

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Add your dataset
# Place your dataset as data/dataset.csv
1. Data Preparation (1_data_preparation.ipynb)
   - Clean and preprocess data
   - Feature engineering (lags, scaling)
   - Adjust for seasonality

2. Modeling (2_modeling.ipynb)
   - Train mediator model (Google Ads spend)
   - Train revenue model using Google Ads as mediator
   - Evaluate using RMSE, RÂ²
   - Analyze feature importance and elasticity
